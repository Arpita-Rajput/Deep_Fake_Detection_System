#FaceTruth-Deepfake Detection System for Images:



## Introduction:-

Deepfakes are synthetic media generated using deep learning techniques, often to create hyper-realistic fake images and videos. 



## Problem Statement:-
The primary challenge is to build a model that can analyze an image and classify it as real or fake (deepfake). 


## Methodology:-
1.Data Collection and Preprocessing
2.Model Architecture
3.Training
4.Prediction
