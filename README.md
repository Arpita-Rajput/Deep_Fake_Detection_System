FaceTruth-Deepfake Detection for Images

Introduction

Deepfakes are synthetic media generated using deep learning techniques, often to create hyper-realistic fake images and videos. 

Problem Statement
The primary challenge is to build a model that can analyze an image and classify it as real or fake (deepfake). 


Methodology
1.Data Collection and Preprocessing
2.Model Architecture
3.Training
4.Prediction


Key Techniques Used
CNN-based Feature Extraction

Transfer Learning with pretrained models

Image Data Augmentation

Regularization to Prevent Overfitting

Binary Classification Metrics for Evaluation

Flask-based Web Deployment
